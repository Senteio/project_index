Sony ICD-PX470 — Accessing and Creating Folders
🗂️ To Access Your Folders

Start from the main “STOP” screen (you should see something like STOP 0m00s FOLDER01).

Press the HOME button (bottom left).

Select Voice Recorder using the ◄ / ► arrow buttons.

Press PLAY/ENTER (center button).

Choose Recorded Files and press PLAY/ENTER.

Select Folders and press PLAY/ENTER.

Choose Built-in Memory (unless you’re using an SD card).

You will now see a list of available folders — for example FOLDER01 (others appear once created).

🆕 To Create a New Folder (FOLDER02–FOLDER05)

While still inside Voice Recorder, press the BACK button once so you’re looking at the folder list (not inside a specific folder).

Press the OPTION button.

Use the ◄ / ► arrows to scroll to Select Folder, then press PLAY/ENTER.

Use the arrows to choose a new folder (e.g., FOLDER02).

Press PLAY/ENTER to confirm.

Now press the red REC/PAUSE button to begin a new recording — this automatically creates that folder if it didn’t already exist.

Press STOP to save the file.

If you go back to the Folders list, you’ll now see both FOLDER01 and FOLDER02.

🧩 Notes

Each storage location (Built-in Memory and SD Card) has five folders total (FOLDER01–FOLDER05).

Empty folders don’t appear until a recording exists inside them.

You can freely switch between folders before recording — the selected folder is where the next file will be saved.

To check your current folder, look at the bottom of your display (e.g., “FOLDER02”).

Short Answer

No — the ICD-PX470 does not allow you to rename folders directly on the recorder.
Each folder name is fixed as FOLDER01 through FOLDER05 in both:

the on-screen menu, and

the internal storage directory (when you connect it to your computer).

💻 However… You Can Rename Folders on Your Computer (with Caution)

If you plug the recorder into your laptop (it mounts like a USB drive), you’ll see a folder structure like this:

VOICE
 ├── FOLDER01
 ├── FOLDER02
 ├── FOLDER03
 ├── FOLDER04
 └── FOLDER05


You can rename these folders in Windows or macOS, but:

The recorder will not recognize renamed folders (e.g., “BookNotes” instead of “FOLDER01”).

It expects the exact names FOLDER01–FOLDER05.

So any renamed folder won’t show up in the recorder’s folder menu.

That means:

Rename them only for your personal organization on your computer, not for use inside the recorder.

✅ Recommended Practice

If you want to label folders by purpose, do this instead:

Keep the folder names as FOLDER01–05.

Create a cheat sheet for reference. For example:

Recorder Folder	Purpose
FOLDER01	Daily Journal
FOLDER02	Book Notes
FOLDER03	WSJ Commentary
FOLDER04	Client Ideas
FOLDER05	Miscellaneous

Then you’ll always know where to record, and you’ll stay compatible with the device’s software.
